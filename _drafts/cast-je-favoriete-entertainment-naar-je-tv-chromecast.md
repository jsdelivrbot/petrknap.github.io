As Microsoft sheep (and Android hater) I never had reason to try *Google Chromecast*.
But the price, 50 USD with TAX in Czech Republic, was very interesting and when I was selecting new television I must do a decision:
**To buy "smart" TV or "just" TV** with smart "box" and **which smart "box" I should choose**?



## To buy "smart" TV or "just" TV?

This decision is very easy - **always buy "just" TV**.
Development of display technology is very slow, but software development is one of the fastest processes which I know.
If you buy "just" TV today, it will be many years as good as today.
If you buy "smart" TV today, **it will be "just" TV in two years due to lack of updates**.

## Fun with smart "box"

The real question is which box you should choose.
I was thinking about *Acer Revo*, *Raspberry pi*, and *Google Chromecast*.
*Revo* was terminated by price, *pi* was my decision until I realized that I need something like wireless HDMI and *Chromecast* is perfect solution for me.

### Eenvouding instellen

It was very surprising when I plug in my new *Chromecast* to my new *LG 32LH530V*.
It's from Netherlands distribution, I love our European Union's single market.

The good news is that the real setup is realized trought another device in correct language and during setup is *Chromecast* switched into the same language.

And how it works? Perfectly, **as wireless HDMI it's perfect**.
It communicates via WiFi and **the output stream consumes about 6 Mbps**.
If you are streaming from WiFi to *Chromecast* on the same WiFi, all data go trough your router and **you need twice as much data to transfer**.
The ideal solution is to use 802.11n standard which provide enough speed.

There are some applications which works with *Chromecast* natively (for example *YouTube*), but the main power is hidden in casting from *Google Chrome* via *Google Cast* extension.
With this extension **you can cast a browser tab, application window or whole screen to your television**, in high resolution (delay included).



# Conclusion

*Google Chromecast* is really **useless if you are looking for media player**.
You need another device which controls it and serves the content.
Buy *Acer Revo* or *Raspberry pi* instead.

*Google Chromecast* is **great for these who can't directly connect theirs devices via HDMI cable**.
It works great with *Windows 10*.
On *Ubuntu 16* it works only for screen casting (without audio).
