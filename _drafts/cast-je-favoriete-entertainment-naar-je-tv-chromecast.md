As Microsoft sheep (and Android hater) I never had reason to try *Google Chromecast*.
But the price, 50 USD with TAX in Czech Republic, was very interesting and when I was selecting new television I must did a decision:
**To buy "smart" TV or "just" TV** with smart "box" and **which smart "box" I should choose**?



## To buy "smart" TV or "just" TV?

This decision was very easy - **always buy "just" TV**.
Development of display technology is very slow, but software development is one of the fastest processes which I know.
If you buy "just" TV, it will be many years as good as today.
If you buy "smart" TV, **it will be "just" TV in two years due to lack of updates**.

I wish to buy non-smart, DirectLED, FullHD, DVB-T2 compatible, 30" television under 400 USD with TAX - [*LG 32LH530V*] was the best.



## Fun with smart "box"

The real question was which box I should choose.
I was thinking about *HTPC*, [*Raspberry pi*] and [*Google Chromecast*].

*HTPC* was terminated by price quickly.
And *Raspberry pi* was my favorite.
Until I realized that **I need something like wireless HDMI** and *Google Chromecast* is perfect solution for me.


### Eenvouding instellen

It was very surprising when I plug in my new *Google Chromecast* to my new *LG 32LH530V*.
It was from Netherlands distribution, I love our European Union's single market.

The good news is that the real setup is realized trough another device in correct language and during setup is *Google Chromecast* switched into the same language.

And how it works? Perfectly, **as wireless HDMI it's perfect**.
It communicates via WiFi and **the output stream consumes about 6 Mb/s**.
If you are streaming from WiFi to *Google Chromecast* on the same WiFi, all data go trough your router and **you need twice as much data to transfer**.
The ideal solution is to use 802.11n standard which provides enough speed.

![Network history](/notes/data/google-chromecast-2/network-history.png)

There are some applications which work with *Google Chromecast* natively (for example [*YouTube*]), but the main power is hidden in casting from [*Google Chrome*] via [*Google Cast*] extension.
With this extension **you can cast a browser tab, application window or whole screen to your television**, in high resolution (delay included).



## Conclusion

*Google Chromecast* is really **useless if you are looking for media player**.
You need another device which controls it and serves the content.
Buy *HTPC* or [*Raspberry pi*] instead.

[*Google Chromecast*] is **great for these who can't directly connect theirs devices via HDMI cable**.
It works great on *Windows 10*.
On *Ubuntu 16* it works only for screen casting (without audio).
Sure applications with native support (for example *YouTube*) works on *Ubuntu 16* as great as on *Windows 10*.
For *Windows Phone* there is application called [*TubeCast for YouTube*] which works.
And finally, for [*VLC*] users, there is **native support in VLC 3**.
